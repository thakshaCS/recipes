    <h3> Description</h3>

    <p>Caramel apple meets cheesecake in this deliciously easy fall dessert that layers apple pie filling with cream
        cheese and caramel sauce to make a glorious filling for a graham cracker crust!</p>
    <p>Great recipe, very simple and easy to make. The instructions are well done. I did my own base instead of a
        pre-made crust. I also used brown sugar when mixing the graham crackers for the base. Extremely tasty and I
        would make it again everyone loved it.</p>

    <h3>Ingridents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (21 ounce) can apple pie filling</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li> ½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup caramel sauce</li>
        <li>12 pecan halves</li>
        <li>⅔ cup chopped pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Reserve 3/4 cup of apple pie filling and set aside. Spoon remaining pie filling into crust.</li>
        <li>Combine cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl; beat until smooth. Add eggs and mix well; pour
            over apple filling in crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are puffed and surface of cheesecake is firm except for a small spot
            in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 35 minutes. Remove from oven and cool to
            room temperature.</li>
        <li>To make the caramel apple topping: Mix reserved apple filling and caramel sauce in a small saucepan over
            medium-low heat until warmed through, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Arrange apple slices around outside edge of cooled cheesecake. Spread caramel sauce evenly on top; decorate
            with pecan halves around edge. Sprinkle with chopped pecans. Chill until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
